Leo the Lurcher
:::

# Welcome to my website!

Leo is a long-time member of the 'adopt-a-pathetic-human' campaign. He represents a descendant of a currently unknown combination of dog breeds, widely rumoured to include lurcher, staffordshire bull-terrier, and labrader (not necessarily in that order).

His research interests include the perception of time during sleep, and the role of vigilance on reaction time in a novel brown rock catching task. He leads the Castleton Canines Facebook group, who continually monitor and police the surrounding areas. while intimidating all possible humans in the process.
